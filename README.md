Created a dashboard using Tableau linked with SQL Workbench


Created a project for sales insights data analysis project using tableau. 

This project will give you a feel of how data analysis projects are executed in big companies. 

Built a Dashboard for a case study  based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market.

Performed data discovery for our sales insights data analysis project and looked at MySQL database . 

This database has all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information. 

Analysed this database and then hooked it up with Tableau. 

After plugging in MySQL database with tableau, I performed data cleaning and ETL (Extract, transform , load). 
(This process is also known as data munging or data wrangling) , Performed currency normalization, handling invalid values etc.

Built a final tableau dashboard for our sales insights project using Sheet and published it.

Dashboard built in phase 1 was revised and after using it for sometimes feedback was taken and, Based on this feedback phase 2 of dashboard was built performing profit analysis and fixing of some issues found in phase 1.
